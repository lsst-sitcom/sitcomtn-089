Abstract
========

This technote focuses on analyzing the system static flexure as a function of elevation, derived from the Laser Tracker measured offsets. It will be updated once data is available to include LUT improvement for the hexapods. For now, this is not possible because the Laser Tracker data was obtained without the hexapods being turned on nor the M2 surrogate being in place.
